# BlinkIt-Power-BI
I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for Blinkit, the online grocery delivery service. It provided actionable insights to help Blinkit optimize their delivery routes, manage stock levels, and improve customer experience.
I had the opportunity to dive deep into Blinkit's data, creating insightful visualizations that provide a comprehensive overview of their operations. Here's what I've visualized:
- Total Sales: Tracking overall revenue trends
- Average Sales: Identifying typical transaction values
- Number of Items: Monitoring product movement
- Average Rating: Gauging customer satisfaction
- Outlet Locations: Mapping geographical performance
- Outlet Size: Analyzing impact of store dimensions on sales

These visualizations offer actionable insights for strategic decision-making, helping to optimize inventory, improve customer experience, and drive sales growth.
